              Sweden is pretty much the only country in the world where it is illegal
              to have narcotic substances in your bloodstream. Lots of countries have
              really odd ways of dealing with the legality of drugs and the treatment (or lack thereof) of addiction, like the current situation in the Philipines.
              The impact of this is that anybody who has consumed a narcotic can be arrested by suspicion alone, to later find your only option to be to pee in a cup or get your blood drawn.
              No distinction is made between substances, one is as bad as all of them. In the eyes of the law, an addict is criminal first, patient second.</p>

            <p class="lead">
              Public drug health policy in Sweden has been in a very special place for a long time now.
              tracing the causes of this leads back to the moonshine days of the earlier centuries and the various systems set up to
              fight nationwide alcoholization, most notably Systembolaget, the policy has been based on moral opinions rather than medical science.</p>

              <p class="lead">So with a legal framework that basically is standing in front of the hospital sticking it's leg out and tripping anyone trying to seek help.
              This creates a sort of catch-22 problem for many addicts, to get the medical help and treatment they need they must be completely clean from any drugs - but to be clean they need
              medical treatment. Addicts seeking help also risk getting into legal trouble since the highest priority is to make them pay for their crime rather than care for their health.</p>
